## Nourish Initiative.  

Gleaners are a vital link between available food and those who need it most. Local producers have surpluses of food that may otherwise go to waste for lack of a way to safely and efficiently bring it to market. Human service agencies face tight budgets and increasing demand for services. Gleaners bring these valuable resources together to help ease the problem of hunger locally.

It takes a team to fight hunger. That team includes donors (food and financial), volunteers, staff, the food bank, and a variety of agency partners. Your support of the entire network is needed. There are many ways to have an impact on your community. We encourage you to consider some of the ways you can help.

And then help us spread the word that people in our communities need help! If you belong to a church, service organization or club that may be interested in hearing about the local impact of hunger and how you can make a difference, please let us know. We love to share our mission and get others involved in our efforts.
